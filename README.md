# Forest-Stack Vocabulary

## Introduction
Forest-Stack Vocabulary is a collection of [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) serialized
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) schemas widely used by Forest-Stack Subsystems and
datasources made available through Forest-Stack Platform.

We build over ideas and concepts standardized by [schema.org](schema.org) and
build custom ontologies and semantic constructs to standardize Forest-Stack operations, data access,
and interoperable data comprehension.

We standardize our schemas with popular structured data schema providers
such as [schema.org](schema.org), [smart data models](https://smartdatamodels.org/),
[iotschema.org](http://iotschema.org/) and [dcat](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#dcat-scope)
wherever possible in an effort to link ontologies and provide for interoperability.

Schemas hosted here are available in web-view format on [Forest-Stack Vocabulary Server](https://voc.forest-stack.iudx.io/)


## Structure
We divide our schemas into the following three categories
- data-types: Basic json data types, such as Number, Boolean, Text, etc
- base-schemas: Core concepts generally used in adex internal operations and general concepts which serve as building blocks to advance concepts
- datamodels: Data comprehension vocabulary for diverse domains of datasources building upon concepts defined in base-schemas
